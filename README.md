# BSearchAutoGenerated

This project contains an implementation for the classical Binary Search Algorithm, 
which is consistent with a CafeOBJ specification of the algorithm. 

More specifically, CafeOBJ is an algebraic specification language, used for the 
verification of distributed systems among other applications.

I have developed a tool called Cafe2JMl which takes as input CafeOBJ specifications
and translates them to equivallent Java Modeling Language Specifications (JML). 
The JML specification can then be manually implemented, and the code
verified against the specification with a variety of tools. 

In this case study I took a specification of the binary search algorithm automatically
in CafeOBJ automatically translated it into an equivalent JML specification
and verified that the Java implementation satisfies the JML spec, and thus also
the original CafeOBJ specification.
